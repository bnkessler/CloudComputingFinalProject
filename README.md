# CloudComputingFinalProject
This is the repository for Ben, Tony, Tuukka, and Jake for v2 of the final project.
In the glue scripts folder, there are two types of documents, processing and api.
The api script documents are what the code would be if the nba_api worked on AWS while the processing documents are versions that pull directly from s3 without calling the nba_api on AWS.
This means we had to manually upload the nba_api data to s3 after pulling it locally.
