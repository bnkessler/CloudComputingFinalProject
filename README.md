# CloudComputingFinalProject
This is the repository for Ben, Tony, Tuukka, and Jake for v2 of the final project.
There are two main folders, glue scripts and all other scripts.
Due to issues with the nba_api on AWS, we have two versions of most documents. One version that would work if nba_api worked on AWS and one that works by pulling the api_data from s3, but that required us to upload the data manually.
